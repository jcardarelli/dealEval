### Three things to know about the deal you're analyzing:
1. How much money does it make?
2. What is your return on investment
3. How does this investment compare to other investments?


### Five key terms:

#### 1. Income and Expenses
	 
   Definition:
   - Income: Rents, lease payments made, laundry income, late fees	
   - Expenses: Insurance, taxes, utilities, repairs/maintenance, management fees. (Mortgage payment is not a line item in expenses).

   Rules:
   - Income > Expenses


#### 2. Net Operating Income (NOI)
	 
   Calculation: ```Income - Expenses```
	 
   Definition:
   - Your income after you subtract your expenses.
   - NOI goes up, so does cash flow, and so does the property value.
   - NOI goes down, so does cash flow, and so does the property value.

  Rules:
  - NOI > Mortgage payment


#### 3. Cash Flow
    
   Calculation: ```NOI - Your annual mortgage payment```
     
   Definition:
   - What your property returns after calculating income, expenses, and your annual mortgage payment.

   Rules:
   - Cash flow must be positive, unless you're Amazon.


#### 4. Cash-on-cash Return
	
   Calculation: ```Annual cash flow / Your down payment```
    
   Definition:
	
   - How fast your money is moving. Your return on investment.
	
        ```"How fast can I get back my 20,000?"
			1 Year  =  100%
			2 Years  =  50%
			3 Years  =  33%
			4 Years  =  25%

   Rules:
   - <pre>>= 10%</pre>

#### 5. Capitalization Rate (cap rate)
	 
   Calculation: ```NOI / Sales price```
     
   Definition:
   - If you paid all cash for an investment, what would your return on investment (ROI) be?
	
   - Each neighborhood has its own cap rate:
     - High cap rate - Low/moderate income neighborhood - higher risk, higher potential return, price is lower
	 - Low cap rate - High income neighborhood - lower risk, lower potential return, price is higher
	
   Rules:
   - <pre>>= 8%</pre>
